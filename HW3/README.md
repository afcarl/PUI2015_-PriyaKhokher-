I have setup the ipython noteboks for this assignment. 
1st assignment - we take samples from different distributions and the central limit theorem which can be described accordingly :
"suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic average of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the average will be distributed according to the normal distribution (commonly known as a "bell curve")" as described by Wikipedia . 
So we have chosen 100 samples of varying sizes of different distribution with adjusted means (to get a mean of 80) and then plotted the histogram that resembles a noraml distribution shape.

The 2nd assignment :
We have done chi-square tests and z score tests for this assignment. we couldnt reject the null hypothesis based on our tests.
