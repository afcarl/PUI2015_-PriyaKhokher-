This is an additional readme file for the 3rd part of the assignment.
I have contributed in the follwing ways:
the hypothesis chosen by our group was suggested by me.
But that was after a lot of good suggestions from my team mates and amazing brainstorming
I have coded parts of it on my own - the central limit part ,the t-test,
but I learnt a lot of csv file merging and better presenatation from my team mates,which is more important than merely coding.

As for the test- I was doing z-score test, but I was very confused as to how that was coming into the picture and helping in the test.
So I emailed Dr.Federica  who troublshooted me with the tests by saying that the t-test was apt here and NOT THE Z-score test.
The z-score test only helps to know how many sigma away is the mean, she said.

So then I inplented the t-test.
I wanted to change the smaple size from 1000 to 10000 to see how it works(as the greater the n , the closer the sample mean distribution centre gets to the 
mean of the main distribution), but as the files as huge, it crashed my system and was very slow. )

We could thereby use different n (even the sqrt of the length of summer data frame and winter data frame), and see the p-values. 
The hypothesis got rejected as p-value was less than the significance level chosen
