Hi,
1. I liked the way you have given your title, labelled axis with units on it. Though it is better to label the y-axis in minutes or hours, because human mind finds it easier to compare in them. Else mental division has to come to the rescue.Also you are not mentioning age anywhere, it is birth year- that means - that you are expecting the viewer to calculate the age of the person from 2015. Again the user of your plot has to calculate it. Your grids are on,which is good.
2. I am little unsure of the colors though- are they colorblind friendly - I actually didnt see palette like this when I checked.
3. Your legend is not in a box, for moment I thought those two were also points on the plot
4. I think you gave an empty space in the initial part to show outliers, if they were not important , then I would suggest to shift the graph to the left. Also, the points get merged down below, so you can increase the y-axis ticks as all fall below 100000 seconds, which can be any value. You maximum data is down there, but no means to compare it, if a user wants to . 
5. You have made it 3d, which is good, and have tried to keep it below 7 elements, which is also a good.

6. Again, down there, the two datasets of male and female are superimposed and I can not see the male rider points at all, to guage their tripduration. You can use alpha to change to transparency, and even check out different marker styles.
7. For a plot like this, even a bar plot would have worked fine,I think, you can always try and see. All in all - GOOD!
Here is your plot :
