Hello,
1. Title is wriiten well, axis is also labelled with units on it, thats good.
2. Legend is also in box, but I think yo could have zoomed in the plot a bit, as I cannot see any value of (Metropolitian Statistical Area) or use alpha.And it might just increase complexity to make it colorblind friendly, but it has to be informational for a normal user. Given that you have tried to give a lot of information.
- I am a little unclear as to what you are trying to achieve with the plot. You are talking about the CO2 emissions by county, and then segregated that into various areas, but you could have made a bar plot here, for each population and tehn made it 3d. Something like this - 'http://kbcdn.tableausoftware.com/images/grouped-bar-chart3.png'
3. There is empty area around the plot, and you can center your plot more and get that into more focus, by limiting your axis so that more points can be seen.
4. Also for the title, I am not sure id you have used the 'plt.title' method, as title automatically comes in **BLOD** . or a little darker. :).Hope you find it helpful!
Here is your plot :
