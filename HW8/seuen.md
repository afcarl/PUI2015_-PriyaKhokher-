I like the plot idea :


1. You have given a title,labelled the axis, your legend postion I am guessing , you have used 'best' as loc paramenter value. I would suggest (something that even I wanted to do but skipped) is to mention the units along with the axis. And also adding additional text box mentioning source of the dataset. The colors that you have used seeem color friendly - nevertheless here are a few useful resources :

2. The plot is clear, I am guessing that airbnb offers lesser price, Right ?
3.You have made two plots, but what is Ldmk ? - Landmark. So instead in the titl
e -and also for your title : It is better to keep that at the center, with capitals in the starting and why underscores when spaces are allowed?:)
Title should suggest the underlying idea of the plot and give you a reason of why it has been plotted : For eg, the title could be - 'AirBnb Listing & Hotel Costing variation with distance ' and added a caption for each plot- a.From Station b. From Landmark(which landmarks are these- you would know)
3. You have shown a lot of information,which is good, you manaed to make it very informational,grids are on, the plot has outline too,the figure size is apt - GOOD !
