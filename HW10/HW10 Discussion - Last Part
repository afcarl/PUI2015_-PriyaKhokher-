On performing two clustering algorithms, namely K-Means and Agglomerative clustering , 
we observe that Brooklyn and Queens are the areas with steady increase in number of establishments.
While areas between queens and brooklyn as well as most of Staten Island have shown erratic behaviour but now are gradually increasing 
their no. of establishments.
While popular small parts of all boroughs exhibit a spike in 1994, while a sharp decrease in the later years, reaching a constant and then 
increasing slightly later in 2012.
While Staten island shows erratic behaviour in the initial years and subsequent increase in the later years- post 2005 due to 
Wall Street growth maybe.

Both the algorithms clustered in almost similar way, 
except that Long Island gets clustered in a different way, showing Long Island parks increasing establsihments in Agglomerative and erratic
trend in K-means.
